I used Rails 5.0.1 and postgresql to make a site called JustPlayIt!

Although I expect to be the only user and this site will be used more for
demonstration purposes, any user can CRUD any videos they wish.  That is, I (or
you, if someone is reading this) can create new videos to sing along with, read
some info on those videos, and update delete them as I (you) wish.

When I have some free time, I would like to make many of the links more
pleasing to the eye and I would like to work on some cool hover effects like
the initial play button burning when you hover over it.
